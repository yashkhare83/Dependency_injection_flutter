# Dependency_injection_flutter

Dependency Injection helps in building scalable and maintainable Flutter apps by managing dependencies in a clean and modular way. Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used in software development to manage how components or classes obtain their dependencies.


### Imagine a Coffee Shop

- Customer Orders a Coffee: The customer asks for a coffee, but they don't care how the coffee is made or where the ingredients come from. 
- They just want their coffee.
- Starbucks Makes the Coffee: The Starbucks is responsible for making the coffee. They need various ingredients like coffee beans, milk, sugar, and water.
- Ingredients Provider: There's a provider that supplies all the ingredients to the Starbucks. The Starbucks just requests what they need.

### Translating to Code
- Customer: The widget that needs some data or service.
- Starbucks: The class that uses the service (e.g., a widget using a coffee service).
- Ingredients Provider: The dependency injection mechanism (like Provider in Flutter) that supplies the necessary services.
